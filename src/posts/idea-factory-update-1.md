One issue that I’ve been struggling with in designing Idea Factory, is deciding how to reward non-monetary contributions. Those of you who have been following the project know that this is a very key part of the design of Idea Factory and something that I think makes it stand out from other projects. Initially, idea tokens were going to be 1:1 with the amount of funds provided to the project but after some careful thought, I’ve decided to go a slightly different route, as I found that that design didn’t reward contributions enough, or made it harder to provide non-monetary value to ideas.

  
The new model follows the popular bounding curve model. For those of you unfamiliar with Token Bounding curves, the key takeaway is that the price of the token increases as more tokens are minted. For idea tokens, tokens will be minted in one of two ways (though potentially more) :

a) When a user provides funds to an idea

b) When a user provides a valuable non-monetary contribution

  
The hope is that, when a user is rewarded for providing some sort of value to the project, whether it be monetary or non-monetary, **the value of the idea increases.** In my opinion, this model provides us with a way to translate an increase in perceived value to actual value. As far as the governance token is concerned, the price of the governance token will still be determined the same way, by calculating the average value of ideas added to the protocol.

As far as the exact formula for the bound curve goes, I'm still looking into options. Something similar to Continuous Organizations as described in [https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/#continuous-organizations](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/#continuous-organizations "https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/#continuous-organizations") would be ideal as that could potentially help the solve the issue of what happens to Ideas after they "graduate" or outgrow Idea Factory.
