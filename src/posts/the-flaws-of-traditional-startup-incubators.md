Let me start of by saying that, I don't think traditional incubators are bad. I've been a part of incubators myself, and they have definitely helped me a lot. With that being said, there are some flaws that I do want to highlight, mainly how centralized incubators are.

The traditional startup incubator is modelled in such a way that the main way that they profit are, of course, based on the valuations and success of the companies they incubate. On a surface level, this seems fine. As long as one of the companies you incubate is worth more than the initial investment it's fine, right? Well, yes, but the chances of that happening are very slim. According to[https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate](https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate "failory"), approximately 90 percent of startups fail. So if we consider an incubator that incubates 10 companies, then only one company is going to succeed. And if even if that company does succeed, there's still no guarantee that they will turn a massive profit.

So what does this have to do with centralization? I'm glad you asked. Since a traditionally startup incubator is a company, that means that they need to make money, and because it's centralized, any profit or loss rests solely on the incubator. In other words, **traditional startup incubators are less likely to take risks in order to not to loss money.** Even if company with a great product or idea applies, that doesn't necessarily mean that they will get incubated, depending on the risk and what the incubator decides. In my opinion, the companies and startups that actually need help from incubators, are less likely to get it because of the above.

Next, let's examine why a large majority of startups fail. The main reason a startup fails is lack of product-market fit. What is product-market fit? Product-market fit means being in the right market, while providing a product that the market is looking for. Basically, your customers should be selling your product for you, instead of you trying to sell the product to them. It is hard to know if you have product-market fit, until you actually launch your product. So how can an incubator determine the value of a startup if they aren't even the ones that will be using the product? I'm sure they can make a pretty good guess, but
